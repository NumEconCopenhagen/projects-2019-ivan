# Dataproject

Should contain a short introduction to your project, and show how to produce your results.

In this project we want to show the relationship between population growth and economic growth which indicates how developed a country is. In doing so we use data from the World Bank, where we look at the World as a whole, but also look at regions and/or countries. The focused variables in this project are the fertility rate and GDP which is very simplified way to look at this.
